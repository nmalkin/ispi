iSPI: Investigating Search Patterns in Interfaces
=================================================

This is the code for an experiment to investigate how people search for objects in interfaces.
(Where do they look? What patterns do they follow?)

The experiment was originally designed for the Brown University class [CS 295J][]: Cognition, Human-Computer Interaction and Visual Analysis.

There are a couple of versions of the experiment (see the different branches of the repo).

You can see it live and try it out (and help us collect data!) at:

[CS 295J]: http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci2950-j.html
